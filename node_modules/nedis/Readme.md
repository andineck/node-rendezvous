# Nedis

  Nedis is a (partial) redis implementation written with node. Primarily for fun.

## Installation

     $ npm install nedis

## Trying It Out

 Since nedis implements the unified redis prototcol, we can use `redis-cli` with nedis! First start the server:

     $ nedis-server

 Now play with the cli:

     $ redis-cli 

     redis> hmset users:tj email tj@vision-media.ca age 23
     OK
     redis> hgetall users:tj
     1) "email"
     2) "tj@vision-media.ca"
     3) "age"
     4) "23"
     redis> keys users:*
     1) "users:tj"
     redis> 

## Booting Nedis

    nedis.createServer().listen([port[, host]]);

## Running Tests

    $ make test
